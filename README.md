# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction-


Overview:
This project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore using a Linear Regression model. The dataset used for this project contains various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and amenities. By analyzing these features, the model predicts the price of houses accurately, aiding both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

Techniques Used:
Linear Regression: Utilized to establish the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (house price).
Data Cleaning: Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Data Evaluation: Employed techniques to evaluate the performance of the model, such as mean squared error, R-squared, and cross-validation.
Technologies Used:
Python: Main programming language used for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
Pandas: Employed for data manipulation and cleaning.
Scikit-learn: Utilized for implementing the Linear Regression model.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualized data distribution, relationships, and model performance.
Project Structure:
Data Collection: Gathered housing data from various sources, including real estate databases and APIs.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and formatted the data to make it suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated the dataset to understand relationships between variables and identify patterns.
Model Building: Developed and trained the Linear Regression model using appropriate features.
Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using relevant metrics and cross-validation techniques.
Deployment: Deployed the model for predicting house prices in Bangalore.
Future Scope:
Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or transformations to enhance model performance.
Advanced Modeling Techniques: Experiment with other regression algorithms or ensemble methods.
Web Application: Develop a user-friendly web interface to allow users to interact with the model easily.
